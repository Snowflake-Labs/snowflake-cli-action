# Snowflake CLI Github Action

**Note:** Snowflake CLI Github Action is in Preview.

## Usage

Streamlines installing and using [Snowflake CLI](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/snowflake-cli-v2/index) in your CI/CD workflows. The CLI is installed in 
isolated way making sure it won't conflict with dependencies of your project.  Automatically set up 
the input config file within the ~/.snowflake/ directory.

This actions enables automation of your Snowflake CLI tasks, such as deploying Native Apps or running Snowpark scripts within your Snowflake environment, etc.

## Inputs

### ` cli-version`

The specified Snowflake CLI version. For example `2.2.0`. If not specified then latest version will be used.


### `default-config-file-path`

Path to the configuration file (config.toml) in your repository. The path must be relative to root of repository.


## How to safely configure the action in your CI/CD workflow
To set up Snowflake credentials for a specific connection follow these steps. 


1. **Add `config.toml` to Your Repository**:
   - Create a `config.toml` file at the root of your repository with an empty connection configuration. For example:

     ```toml
     [connections]
     [connections.myconnection]
     user = ""
     ```

   This file serves as a template and is preferable to not contain any actual credentials.

2. **Generate a private key**:
   Generate a key pair for you snowflake account following this [user guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth).

   

3. **Store Credentials in GitHub Secrets**:
   - Store each credential (e.g., account, private key, passphrase) in GitHub Secrets. Refer to the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) for detailed instructions on how to create and manage secrets for your repository.



4. **Map Secrets to Environment Variables**:
   - Map each secret to an environment variable using the format `SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTIONS_<connection-name>_<key>=<value>`. This overrides the credentials defined in `config.toml`. For example:

     ```yaml
     env:
       SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTIONS_MYCONNECTION_PRIVATE_KEY_RAW: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_RAW }}
       SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTIONS_MYCONNECTION_ACCOUNT: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT }}
     ```

5. **Configure the Snowflake CLI Action**:
   - Add the `default-config-file-path` parameter to the Snowflake CLI action step in your workflow file. This specifies the path to your `config.toml` file. For example:

     ```yaml
     - uses: Snowflake-Labs/snowflake-cli-action@v1
       with:
         cli-version: "latest"
         default-config-file-path: ".\config.toml"
     ```

   Replace `latest` with a specific version of Snowflake CLI action if needed.

6. **[Optional] Set up a passphrase if private key is encrypted**:
   - Add an additional environment variable named `PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE` and set it to the private key passphrase. This passphrase will be used by Snowflake to decrypt the private key.

     ```yaml
        - name: Execute Snowflake CLI command
          env:
          PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE: ${{ secrets.PASSPHARSE }}
          run: |
           snow --version
           snow connection test
     ```

7. **[Extra] Using password instead of private key**:
   - Unset the environment variable `SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTIONS_MYCONNECTION_AUTHENTICATOR` and then add a new variable with the password as follows:

     ```yaml
     env:
        SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTIONS_MYCONNECTION_USER: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_USER }}
        SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTIONS_MYCONNECTION_ACCOUNT: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT }}
        SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTIONS_MYCONNECTION_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD }}

     ```




For more information in setting Snowflake credentials using environment variables, refer to the [Snowflake CLI documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli-v2/connecting/specify-credentials#how-to-use-environment-variables-for-snowflake-credentials). And the instructions on defining environment variables within your Github CI/CD workflow can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#defining-environment-variables-for-a-single-workflow).

## Full example usage

### Configuration file 

```
default_connection_name = "myconnection" 
  
[connections] 
[connections.myconnection]
user = ""
```



### YAML file 
```yaml
name: deploy
on: [push]
jobs:
  version:
     name: "Check Snowflake CLI version"
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     env:
        SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTIONS_MYCONNECTION_AUTHENTICATOR: SNOWFLAKE_JWT
        SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTIONS_MYCONNECTION_USER: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_USER }}
        SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTIONS_MYCONNECTION_ACCOUNT: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT }}
        SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTIONS_MYCONNECTION_PRIVATE_KEY_RAW: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_RAW }}


     steps:
          # Checkout step is necessary if you want to use a config file from your repo
        - name: Checkout repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
          with:
            persist-credentials: false

          # Snowflake CLI installation
        - uses: Snowflake-Labs/snowflake-cli-action@v1
          with:
            cli-version: "latest"
            default-config-file-path: "config.toml"
        
          # Use the CLI
        - name: Execute Snowflake CLI command
          env:
          PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE: ${{ secrets.PASSPHARSE }} #Passphrase is only necessary if private key is encrypted. 
          run: |
           snow --version
           snow connection test
```
